Millenary Petition was a list of requests given to James I by Puritans in 1603 when he was travelling to London in order to claim the English throne. This carefully worded document expressed Puritan distaste regarding the state of the Anglican Church, and took into consideration James' religious views as well as his liking for a debate, as written in <i>Basilikon Doron.</i>While many of the main Puritan goals were rebutted, the petition did culminate in the Hampton Court Conference, which eventually led James to commission a new English translation of the bible, now known as the King James Version.","eventType":"Religion","sources":"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://history.hanover.edu/texts/ENGref/er88.html\">Online text of the Millenary Petition</a>","wikipedia":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millenary_Petition","origin":"http://duncanandmeg.org/projects/kjv/timeline.html#Millenary%20Petition"},{"id":"Richard Bancroft's anti-Puritan canons receive royal approval","label":"Richard Bancroft's anti-Puritan canons receive royal approval","type":"Item","uri":"https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/cells/0Al49R2dL41V5dGZEQ2JQaE0zY21yejk5V3pySTl6NHc/od6/public/item#Richard%20Bancroft's%20anti-Puritan%20canons%20receive%20royal%20approval","start":"1604-03","description":"\"The tension between the prelates of the official church and the Puritans grew during James's reign. In 1604, Richard Bancroft, archbishop of Canterbury, had a series of canons approved in which it was affirmed that episcopal hierarchy was an institution of divine origin, and that without it there could be no true church. This implied a rejection of the many Protestant churches on the Continent that had no bishops, and therefore Puritans saw in it a step towards breaking away from Protestant ties in order to reintroduce Catholicism in England. Besides this, several other canons approved on the archbishop's insistence were clearly directed against Puritans.\"","eventType":"Religion","sources":"Gonzalez, Justo L. <i>The Story of Christianity: The Reformation to the Present Day.</i> Vol. 2. 1st ed.

They give the reader, therefore, a seventeenth-century text in mid-eighteenth century clothes—clothes which are neither original nor modern. In this new edition of the King James Version the text has been collated with the translators' original work in order to give the reader as closely as possible the exact text on which the translators decided. It has also been given consistent modern spelling and presentation in order to make it easier to read and study than standard editions. The text is presented is paragraph form, with marginal notes. The type is 10/12.5 Swift.
