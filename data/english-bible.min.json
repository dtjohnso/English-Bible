This implied a rejection of the many Protestant churches on the Continent that had no bishops, and therefore Puritans saw in it a step towards breaking away from Protestant ties in order to reintroduce Catholicism in England.

Certainly many of those who read it when it first appeared were never the same again, and it signalled the end of what had hitherto been a flourishing literature on biblical theology.</p><p>&quot;In recent years,&quot; Barr writes in the Preface, &quot;I have come to believe that one of the greatest dangers to sound and adequate interpretation of the Bible comes from the prevailing use of procedure which, while claiming to rest upon a knowledge of the Israelite and Greek ways of thinking, constantly mishandles and distorts the linguistic evidence of the Hebrew and Greek languages as they are used in the Bible. The increasing sense of dependence upon the Bible in the modern church only makes this danger more serious. The fact that these procedures have never to my knowledge been collected, analysed, and criticized in detail was the chief stimulus to my undertaking of this task myself.&quot;</p><p>His conclusions brought much criticism initially, but forty years later they still stand.

The CSB follows the same basic translation philosophy as the HCSB, a mediating approach between formal and functional equivalence, similar to versions like the NIV, the NET Bible and the CEB. The CSB removes a number of the HCSB’s idiosyncracies, such as the use of "Yahweh" for the tetragrammaton (YHWH). Most significantly, the CSB departs from its predecessor by positively embracing "gender-accurate" language, for example, by translating the Greek ἀδελφοί as "brothers and sisters" when the referent includes both men and women.
